- personal setup for notes generation
- requires bower, grunt, npm and pandoc
- notes are written in Markdown, and placed in the ```src``` directory
- overkill much? probably, initially wanted to use this as an opportunity to pick up a front-end framework but then work / school assignments came along
- Why not jekyll? because I wasn't familiar with it when this workflow was created
- probably gonna switch to jekyll if I ever require a similar setup in the future
